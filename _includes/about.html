                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I’m an Italian-born digital strategist and aspiring web developer.</p>
                <p>I have spent the last three months attending General Assembly’s <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">Web Development Immersive</a> program, learning the key concepts of programming while building websites, APIs and data-driven apps in JavaScript and Ruby, both on my own and in team.</p>
                <p>Strong of my fresh programming skills and business background, I’m now eager to to gain experience as junior web developer in London’s tech scene.</p>
